# Endangered-Species
Data Science project - Predicting the risk of extinction of animals


Step 1 - I applied crawling to get data from the website with the Animal characteristics

Step 2 - I converted the data to CSV file and converted all scales to one scale.

Step 3 - I cleaned the data and used mean function to fill the missed numeric data.

Step 4 - I analyzed and vizulazied the data to draw conclusions.

Step 5 - I tested a few models and checks if I can predict if the animal is endangered and received accuracy of 83%
